# 📱 Backend Microservices App – MobilePay-style Platform
This project is a backend service designed as a microservices-based system similar to MobilePay, developed during the Web Services course at DTU in collaboration with my group.

## Key features:

- 💸 Money transfer, 📊 reporting, and 🧾 account management via REST and SOAP APIs

- 📬 Asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ

- ✅ End-to-end and integration testing implemented with Cucumber

- 🔁 CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, with automated testing and deployment to a virtual machine

I contributed significantly to the development, testing, and integration of the platform throughout the course.
